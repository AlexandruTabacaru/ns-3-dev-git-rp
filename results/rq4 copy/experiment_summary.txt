RQ4: Prague vs BBRv3 Fairness in L4S - Experiment Summary
==========================================================

Research Question:
How do competing scalable controllers (TCP Prague and ECN-enabled BBRv3) 
interact within the L4S framework in terms of fairness when sharing a 
wired bottleneck link?

Test Configuration:
- Bottleneck: 100 Mbps, 20ms RTT (10ms one-way delay)
- Duration: 60 seconds
- Traffic: Long-lived bulk transfers (MaxBytes = 0)
- Queue: Single DualPI2 (both algorithms use L4S queue)
- Random seed: 1

Experiments Conducted:
======================

Test ID  | Prague Flows | BBRv3 Flows | Description
---------|--------------|-------------|---------------------------
P1-B1    | 1            | 1           | Balanced competition
P1-B2    | 1            | 2           | Prague minority
P2-B1    | 2            | 1           | BBRv3 minority  
P1-B4    | 1            | 4           | Heavy BBRv3 load
P4-B1    | 4            | 1           | Heavy Prague load
P2-B2    | 2            | 2           | Balanced multiple flows
P4-B4    | 4            | 4           | Heavy mixed load

Analysis Focus:
- Jain's Fairness Index between algorithms
- Per-flow throughput distribution
- Queueing delay comparison (enhanced analytics)
- Algorithm-specific behavior patterns

Expected Outcomes:
- Both algorithms should achieve good fairness (JFI > 0.8)
- Similar queueing delay characteristics (both use L4S)
- Stable coexistence without starvation
